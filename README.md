# Project 1

This project is about a web page for book reviews.

The "application.py" contains the routes and logic to access the project pages.

The "index.html" contains a button to log in or register.

In "register.html", you can register an email, username and password for your account.

In "login.html", you can login with your registered account.

In "bookreview.html", you can search for the book you want. There are 5,000 books for research in the database.

When you click on a searched book, you access the "book.html", which contains the information of the book and can review the book, only one per account.

You can go to "/ api / isbn" to get the website's API.
